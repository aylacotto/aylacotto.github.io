<h4>SETTING AND SCENE</h4>
<div> You are on a hidden planet, you like to discover new things. You just got a new ship so now you're traveling across the multiverse. As you're walking around discovering new species, elements, and cool looking stones, suddenly what you hear gets you scared. You hear talking and what sounds like an engine. You didn't come with anyone and you heard this planet is awfully quiet. Suddenly you look up and thats when you see the most ugly tall purple panini looking man. You're in shock, then in your mind you're realizing who you are face to face with its Thanos, Ronan, Gamora, Nebula, and others. They look like they are ready to kill you. You have five choices, run away, join Thanos, call the avenges and fight, play dead or break into dance. Which one will you choose??? </div>
